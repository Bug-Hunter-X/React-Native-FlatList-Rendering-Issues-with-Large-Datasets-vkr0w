This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that even with `keyExtractor` properly implemented, the FlatList might still render incorrectly, displaying duplicate or missing items, or failing to update correctly after data changes. This is often due to an underlying performance issue where React Native struggles to efficiently manage the list's internal state and reconciliation process with massive datasets or frequent updates.
