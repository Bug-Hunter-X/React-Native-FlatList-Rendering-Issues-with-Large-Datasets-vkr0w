This repository demonstrates a common performance-related bug in React Native's FlatList component when handling large datasets. The bug manifests as incorrect rendering, including duplicate or missing items, even with a correctly implemented `keyExtractor`.  The solution explores techniques to optimize FlatList performance, improving data handling and reducing the load on the rendering process.  This is a practical example of handling performance bottlenecks in React Native development.
