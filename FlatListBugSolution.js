The solution focuses on improving the performance of the FlatList component. We can use techniques like windowing or virtualization to only render the visible items.  Here's an example using React Native's built-in `windowSize` and `maxToRenderPerBatch` props of the FlatList:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
  windowSize={10} // Render 10 items around the visible area
  maxToRenderPerBatch={5} // Render a maximum of 5 items per batch
/>
```

Another approach is to use a third-party library like `react-native-fast-image` for efficient image loading or `react-native-virtualized-list` which provides more advanced virtualization capabilities.  Choosing the right approach depends on the complexity and size of your data and the specific performance bottleneck you are trying to solve.
